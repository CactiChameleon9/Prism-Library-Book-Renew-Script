# Prism Library Book Renew Script
An renew script for librarymanagementcloud's prism online library web app

## Usage
Download the script RenewBooks.sh and change the `PRISM_URL`, `LIB_PIN`, and `LIB_CARD` variables

## Extra Info
This is tested working as of 26th June 2022, but could break in the future to do web scraping needed to get info without an api

I do not know if all prism instances are the same, but this works on mine

This was made this by analysing the network tab while pressing buttons, and then attempting to recreate requests in curl

It is not my fault if you get banned etc. etc.
